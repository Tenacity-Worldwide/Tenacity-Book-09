At her previous high school she disclosed her HIV status to </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1dd2 ffb8 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the Vice Principal and was told that unless she informed the whole school, she would have to leave. </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1dd3 ffb8 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">So she left – but not before the staff was informed of her HIV status.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y1dd4 ffb8 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“There are many heart-breaking stories of little kids being humiliated because of a disease they </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1dd5 ffb8 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">inherited.

Stephanie </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1ddf ffb8 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">feels that she owes her survival to the camp, and to the support and strength she has received from </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1de0 ffb8 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">her mother and HIV-positive friends.
