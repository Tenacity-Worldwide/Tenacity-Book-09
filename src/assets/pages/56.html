Of course, it </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7c3 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">frightens your opponent too.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7c4 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Mondli held his body stiff and </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7c5 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">copied Phindile.

And what are these tricks he is </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7c9 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">doing?”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7ca ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Nosipho shrank away from her cousin. “His name is Phindile and he’s in my class,” she answered </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7cb ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">unwillingly. “He’s teaching Mondli how to do karate.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7cc ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Karate, eh?”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7cd ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">She could see that he was impressed. He went back to the kitchen, but she knew that he was still </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7ce ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">standing there, watching from the window.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7cf ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">After a time, Phindile stopped and said, “OK, my man, that’s enough for now. You must practise and </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7d0 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I’ll teach you some more next time. If you keep on long enough, one day you’ll be able to chop a brick in </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7d1 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">half with the side of your hand.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d2 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Temba stepped out and greeted him casually. “That’s not bad, bra. Where did you learn those tricks?”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d3 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Karate is not tricks. It’s self defence. I’m learning it at the Youth Club.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d4 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“It could be useful though in a fight. You could kill a man like that.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d5 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Nosipho could almost see Temba’s brain working as he smiled thoughtfully at Phindile.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d6 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Hey, no, karate is not for killing! It’s a way to defend yourself if you run into a bad situation.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d7 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Hmm,” said Temba. “I think I must learn this stuff too. How about a few lessons, bra?”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7d8 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Sorry,” said Phindile briefly. “I don’t have the time. I have work to do. But you can learn it at the </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7d9 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Youth Club at the Community Centre.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7da ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Nosipho walked with Phindile to the gate.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7db ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Is Temba your brother?” he asked.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7dc ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Oh no, he’s my cousin. He’s supposed to go and live with his father, but we haven’t heard a word </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7dd ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">from him. And he doesn’t send any money for Temba’s food. It’s hard for my mother, but he won’t listen </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7de ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">to her.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7df ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Take care with him,” warned Phindile darkly. “I’ve seen him with his friends. They are not good </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7e0 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">news. And don’t let Mondli hang around with Temba, he will pick up bad habits.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7e1 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“He already has,” she sighed. “He thinks it’s smart to do no work and act tough.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7e2 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“I’ll take him down to the Youth Club with me and get him interested,” said Phindile. “Ask your </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7e3 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">mother if I can do that. There’s a lot going on there to keep him busy and off the street.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y7e4 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“I’ve lived here all my life and I never knew there was a Youth Club,” she said. “My mother would be </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y7e5 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">very pleased if you could get Mondli away from those boys he goes around with.”</div><div class="t m0 xbb h7e y7e6 ff42 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Nosipho and the king of Bones by Ginny Swart</div></div><div class="t m0 xd h12 y14 ff44 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls1 ws0">M03_ENG_SB_ETHG9_0247_U03.indd   50<span class="_ _68"> </span>28/3/11   10:03:28 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
