It had a </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b6b ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">round body, short legs, a large head and a very </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b6c ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">large beak with a hook at the end. At that time </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b6d ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">there were lots of dodos on the island. Ships went </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b6e ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">to Mauritius and when the sailors went ashore, </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b6f ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">they hunted the dodos for fresh meat to eat. The </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b70 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">dodos could not fly, so they were easy prey for the </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b71 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">hunters. Later on, settlers arrived on the island </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b72 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">with their domestic animals. Their pigs destroyed </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b73 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">many of the eggs and ate the young dodos. After </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b74 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">many years there were no dodos left on the island, </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b75 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and the bird became extinct.

People are killing so </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b79 ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">many elephants that soon there will be none left. Men kill elephants because they want the ivory </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b7a ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">from their tusks to make ornaments and jewellery. People who buy ivory pay the hunters to kill the </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b7b ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">elephants.

Today, </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1b7f ffaf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">although only five kinds survive, they are still hunted and killed for their horns.
