It is the most endangered animal of Ethiopia, with only about seven packs </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y93e ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">remaining, totalling roughly 550 adults. Although the Simien fox is mainly a solitary hunter of </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y93f ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">rodents, it lives in packs that share and defend an exclusive territory. Social gatherings among </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y940 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">different packs are more common during the breeding season, and take place very close to the den. </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y941 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">The Simien fox has long legs and a narrow pointed muzzle. It weighs between 11–19 kilograms and </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y942 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">has small, widely spaced teeth. Its coat is ochre to rusty red on the face, ears and upper portions of </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y943 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the body, and white to pale ginger on the underparts. The end of the tail is a thick brush of black </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y944 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">hairs on the tip. The animal has small white spots on the cheeks, and white rims below the eyes. </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y945 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">The contrast of red and white markings increases with its age and social rank.
