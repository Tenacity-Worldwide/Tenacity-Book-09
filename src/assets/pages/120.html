This tall (1.78m), </div><div class="t m0 xcd h20 y1059 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">elegant and confident model was born and grew up in Addis Ababa. She </div><div class="t m0 xcd h20 y105a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">grew up with her grandparents and was very restless as a child. She says </div><div class="t m0 xcd h20 y105b ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">she bothered her grandparents to take her everywhere.

She said, before she took the </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1062 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">modelling training in Habesha Modelling, she could not even ‘walk’. Nardos believes the training </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1063 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">opened the door for her and enabled her to see what she has to offer. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y1064 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">So far, Nardos has won various crowns: <span class="ff76">Miss Virgin</span>, <span class="ff76">Miss Millennium</span>, <span class="ff76">Miss Coffee</span>, and <span class="ff76">Top Model</span>. </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1065 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">She told us proudly that she received five crowns in the five contests she entered in locally. She </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1066 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">has also travelled to Asia and the Middle East (China, Japan, Philippines and Dubai) to take part in </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1067 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">various contests. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y1068 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Nardos enjoys reading books (especially those related to politics) and writing poems. She spends </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1069 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">her leisure time in quiet places, as well as swimming. She sees herself as a good listener. “I love to </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">listen to people, rather than talking to them.” Asked what it was like to win her first contest, Nardos </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106b ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">said, “It was the <span class="ff76">Miss Virgin</span> contest. I was really excited and proud to have received the crown and </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106c ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">to promote the virtue of being a virgin.” </div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y106d ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Many parents are not happy to send their children to modelling and beauty contests, believing </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106e ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">that they will fall behind in their education and become vulnerable to bad influences. We asked </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106f ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Nardos if she had met any such resistance. Nardos replied, “No, my parents believed in me. They </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1070 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">don’t interfere in my choices. They respect my decisions and selections, and they encourage me in </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1071 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">every way.”</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y1072 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">She feels bad that we Africans do not win in global beauty contests, although she believes that </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1073 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">we are beautiful. “It is sad that we do not get the chance to win in big international competitions. </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1074 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">All the judges say is: “Oh you are Ethiopian, wow … beautiful!” But when they sit on their chairs, </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1075 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">they don’t open up their eyes and look into our inner and natural beauty.
