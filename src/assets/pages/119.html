One day, when preparing food for </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1038 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">her family, Kibnash made a few extra injera, </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1039 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">which she sold on the streets. Word soon got </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">round, and a local hotel asked her to make </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103b ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">injera for them. But the problem was that </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103c ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Kibnash was limited in how many she could make because she could not afford to buy much grain </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103d ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">or firewood. So she went to the local loan-sharks and borrowed a little money from them, even </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103e ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">though their rates of interest were very high.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y103f ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Then a local credit union began. “You could get a loan, but you had to save for six months first,” </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1040 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Kibnash said. “I couldn’t afford the two birr every week, but I managed, borrowing from friends </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1041 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">when I didn’t have the money.” </div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y1042 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Six months later she was allowed to apply for a loan – worth ten times her savings, so long as </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1043 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the credit union approved of her business plan. With the money, she bought teff in bulk at half the </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1044 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">price she had paid previously, and began to work full time. The hotel wanted all she could produce, </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1045 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">so she took on an assistant.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y1046 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Kibnash proved to be an acute businesswoman. After a year she realised she had outgrown the </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1047 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">hotel and switched to providing snacks for a nearby school that had 3,000 students. For four years it </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1048 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">brought an increased profit, but as the number of pupils at the school changed and the rent there </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1049 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">rose, business fell away. She decided to change her business again.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y104a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“I had been increasing my savings and my loans as the years went by. But now I borrowed 3,500 </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y104b ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">birr to buy a doughnut frying machine, and I set up this tea shop,” she said proudly, gesturing </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y104c ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">around the little tea-shop at the front of her home. It is such a success that she has taken on two </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y104d ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">more staff. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y104e ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Kibnash has just taken 6,000 birr from her account to buy a new fridge freezer.
