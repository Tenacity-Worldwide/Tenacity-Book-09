Young girls would make skirts out of leaves they </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y13fb ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">collected in the forest, and wear them with beads. In fact, my first design for children’s clothes was </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y13fc ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">influenced by the girls of the Masango group.”</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y13fd ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">In school, Sara was very good at drawing. “My favourite subjects were women, that I dressed in </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y13fe ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">whatever my imagination would create for them. There was one teacher in particular who noticed </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y13ff ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">what I was doing – she encouraged me and said that I should learn how to make clothes.” In Dembi </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1400 ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Dollo Sara began taking sewing lessons, and that was the beginning of a life <span class="_ _6e"></span>long career.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y1401 ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">At the age of 16 Sara moved to Addis Ababa where she finished high school and continued </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1402 ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">taking dress-making lessons.
